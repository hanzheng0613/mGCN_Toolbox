## OpenAttMultiGL: An Open Source Toolbox for Attributed Multi-layer Graph Learning

In recent years, there has been a significant focus on utilizing Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) to model graph data, leading to the devel-
opment of many graph learning tools. These tools aim to enhance
the understanding and utilization of GNNs across various applica-
tions. However, most existing tools are dedicated to single layer
graphs, where there is only one single relation/layer in a graph,
overlooking the complexity of real-world graphs that often involve
multiple types of relations represented as multi-layer graphs. To
address this, we introduce OpenAttMultiGL, an open-source tool-
box designed specifically for attributed multi-layer graph learning.
OpenAttMultiGL provides a user-friendly interface and adaptability
for various tasks such as node classification, node clustering, and
link prediction. The toolbox offers a unified framework for data pre-
processing, splitting, visualization, model training, and prediction
for different downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on attrib-
uted multi-layer graph datasets demonstrate how OpenAttMultiGL
can be used for various downstream tasks and verify its ability to
visualize attributed multi-layer graph data
